# Day 4

For this week, there aren't any hard-and-fast rules about what to do and what
not to do. The topics we covered are quite advanced and you will probably don't
need them often. It's not necessary to practice them until mastery. It is
equally valuable to do more general problem solving exercises to get more
practice with the fundamentals.

## Rustlings

For this week's topics, I don't find the rustlings exercises to be great. Feel
free to skip them entirely if you're not having fun with them.

- smart pointers
- threads
- There are a few more topics, but we didn't and won't cover them. Of course,
  feel free to do the remaining exercises, but be prepared to study the related
  topics on your own.

## Exercism

There are a couple exercises on Exercism that I consider very good for
practicing the topic we covered today. There wasn't anything for drop, shared
ownership and interior mutability, so I made a custom exercise.

- `Box`: [Simple Linked List](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/simple-linked-list)
- drop, shared ownership, interior mutability: (custom) [apple counter](https://github.com/senekor/rust-exercises/day_4/apple_counter)
- multi-threading: [Parallel Letter Frequency](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/parallel-letter-frequency)
- dynamic dispatch: (difficult!) [React](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/react)

## Advent of Code

Due to the nature of Advent of Code, you can solve pretty much every exercise
without using any of the advanced features of Rust. You can either keep
polishing the fundamentals or try to apply some advanced techniques where it's
possible (although probably not necessary). Intenional over-engineering, so to
speak. Most importantly, have fun!
